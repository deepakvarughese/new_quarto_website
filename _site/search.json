    "text": "In this first post on Maps we look to create a very simple map using R Programming.\nFor this project i used R (as usually) and worked with various libraries including ggplot and sf predominantly. I used the Overpass API at https://overpass-turbo.eu/ to collect the shapefiles. (A shapefile is a GIS file that contains various points and polygons for a given areas. ) A lot of the polygons are crowdsourced from the OpenStreetMaps (OSM) community. I used the sf package to open the shapefiles and plot them. I used ggplot2 to create the charts. A lot of the text formatting was done using the showtext package to handle fonts.\n\nThe map is a bit busy. While I would ideally consider making it an interactive map using leaflet I wanted to maintain today’s challenge as a chart. The labels look a bit crowded but i felt the purpose of the chart was labelling today so I kept that as is. I also highlighted the Mallapally Town in the map. I referenced the color by using the same color brown in the description so that it would act as a key of sorts. I have also stuck to good basics by adding a North Arrow and a Scale. This was added using the ggspatial package.\nThis was part one of this series. I hope to build on this chart in future."

    "text": "In the second map of this series i decided to take on a very simple chloropleth map that shows the distribution of population in the South Indian State of Kerala. A chloropleth map often shows different geographic regions that have been shaded according to particular variable.\nFor this map we obtained the administrative borders using overpass from OSM and downloaded the adm_5 layer as adm_5 usually shows the map at the level of district. We then obtained the 2011 Census Data. Yes, this is old census data - but it was the last census that was done. We will assume that overall trends in population may still be the same.\nWe then used different functions on dplyr and stringR to clean the data and finally performed a left_join to merge the population data into the shapefile.\nWe then used ggplot2 for the plotting. We experimented a little with fonts and settled on an informal handwritten type font from the googlefonts collection. The colors were handled by RColorBrewer and i picked a green palate to correlate with the lush vegetation present in Kerala. I avoided the temptation to label each and everything and focused on a simple question of “Which is the district with the highest population”. This allowed me to keep the map more clean and stick to communicating a single message.\nThis was also an exercise in speed as I tried to complete it in limited time rather than focus on the details for too long. Overall a good experience. Hope to keep this going."

Data Science revolves around a statistics, good domain knowledge (really understanding the field) and good programming knowledge. A solid foundation in statistics is foundational for Data Science. Traditional Biostatistics also requires an understanding of domain knowledge. Data Science however places a much more heavier focus on programming skills in comparison to traditional biostatistics. There is also a more strong focus on dealing with secondary data (that has been collected for other reasons) while traditional biostatistics has usually preferred to deal with primary data( that has been collected specifically for this purpose.) Data Scientists also typically deal with tasks such as Machine Learning and Product Development when compared to traditional biostatistics. That is not to say that the skills are not transferrable. There is certainly a lot of overlap. Some of the biggest names in the Data Science Community have come from the world of biostatistics. In fact a solid foundation in statistics can be foundational in building a strong data science profile."

    "text": "How do computers work ?\n\nComputers are made up of billions of transistors that can either be in a state of being open or closed. They decide on whether to be open or closed depending on a series of commands that are written as 0 and 1.\n\nA series of 0s and 1s often tell the computer what to do.\n\nFor example\n0000110000000001000011010000000100000010000011000001101\nThis may possibly be a series of binary code that can tell the computer to add 1+1."

    "text": "Talking to a computer. What happens behind the scenes.\nA high-level programming language is usually used by a developer to tell the computer what to do.\n\nHigh-Level Programming languages are written in English but still need to follow a particular syntax. These are relatively easier to write.\n\nA High Level Programming language is converted to a what is called assembly code by a compiler. Assembly code is usually never written directly since it depends on the type of processor one is using.\n\nThe assembly code is then assembled to binary code by an assembler. This is a series of 1s and 0s.\n\nBinary code is then converted to electric signals which are used by the processor to do the actual computing."

(This is FINE)\n\nGUIs are about visual elements like Icons, Windows , Menus and Buttons. GUIs allow the user to use a mouse to point and click to execute functions that run at the backend without the user having to worry about it.\n\nThe GUIs are themselves written in a high-level programming language like Java , C++ , Python or R.\nFor example - Microsoft Excel or SPSS is written in a combination of languages like C++, Java and FORTRAN . So everytime a button is clicked a function in that respective language is executed at the backend without the user having to worry about it."
