## 30 Day Map Challenge

This is a quick page to display all the maps I made as part of #30DayMapChallenge in November 2023. This is a challenge across the mapping community as a way to display better mapping practices. Through this I hope to bring together my love for GIS and Data Viz in order to create better and more compelling visualizations.
