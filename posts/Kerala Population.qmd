In the second map of this series i decided to take on a very simple chloropleth map that shows the distribution of population in the South Indian State of Kerala. A chloropleth map often shows different geographic regions that have been shaded according to particular variable.

For this map we obtained the administrative borders using `overpass` from OSM and downloaded the adm_5 layer as adm_5 usually shows the map at the level of district. We then obtained the 2011 Census Data. Yes, this is old census data - but it was the last census that was done. We will assume that overall trends in population may still be the same.

We then used different functions on `dplyr` and `stringR` to clean the data and finally performed a `left_join` to merge the population data into the shapefile.

We then used `ggplot2` for the plotting. We experimented a little with fonts and settled on an informal handwritten type font from the `googlefonts` collection. The colors were handled by `RColorBrewer` and i picked a green palate to correlate with the lush vegetation present in Kerala. I avoided the temptation to label each and everything and focused on a simple question of "Which is the district with the highest population". This allowed me to keep the map more clean and stick to communicating a single message.

This was also an exercise in speed as I tried to complete it in limited time rather than focus on the details for too long. Overall a good experience. Hope to keep this going.
