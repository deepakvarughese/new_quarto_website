## How do computers work ?

\
Computers are made up of billions of transistors that can either be in a state of being open or closed. They decide on whether to be open or closed depending on a series of commands that are written as 0 and 1.\
\
A series of 0s and 1s often tell the computer what to do.\
\
*For example*

`0000110000000001000011010000000100000010000011000001101`

This may possibly be a series of binary code that can tell the computer to add 1+1.

## Talking to a computer. What happens behind the scenes.

A *high-level* programming language is usually used by a developer to tell the computer what to do.\
\
**High-Level Programming languages** are written in English but still need to follow a particular syntax. These are relatively easier to write.\
\
A High Level Programming language is converted to a what is called ***assembly code*** by a **compiler**. Assembly code is usually never written directly since it depends on the type of processor one is using.\
\
The assembly code is then assembled to **binary code** by an **assembler.** This is a series of 1s and 0s.\
\
Binary code is then converted to **electric signals** which are used by the processor to do the actual computing.\
\

## I don't write any code. Why does this matter to me?

Most users use **Graphic User Interfaces (GUIs)** to interact with the computer. (This is FINE)\

GUIs are about visual elements like Icons, Windows , Menus and Buttons. GUIs allow the user to use a mouse to point and click to execute functions that run at the backend without the user having to worry about it.\
\
The GUIs are themselves written in a high-level programming language like Java , C++ , Python or R.

For example - Microsoft Excel or SPSS is written in a combination of languages like C++, Java and FORTRAN . So everytime a button is clicked a function in that respective language is executed at the backend without the user having to worry about it.

# So why am I explaining this?

## What is R

R is a high level programming language

Built with a **focus** on

-   Statistics

-   Data Visualizations

It has hence grown to have **many other applications\
**

-   Interactive App Development

-   AI and Machine Learning

-   Presentations (This presentation is written in R!)

-   Reports

-   Website Development

## **Maps Using R**

## Advantages of Using R

-   Free

-   Open Source

-   Reproducible

-   Very Flexible (Talk DIRECTLY to the computer without a GUI)

-   Very Powerful

    \

## Barriers to Using R

-   Steep-Learning Curve with Mental Blocks ( CAN BE OVERCOME)

## Other Considerations

**Have Lots of Funding?**\

-   SPSS / STATA for Analysis

-   ArcGIS for Mapping

-   Hire a Web-Developer and Outsource work

## Other Considerations

**Want a Graphical User Interface ?**

-   Paid Tools as above

-   Microsoft Office (Excel , Powerpoint)

-   Google Sheets , Google Slides

-   Free Tools

    -   Only for Statistics - Consider JAMOVI (Which is a GUI for easy access to R)

    -   Only for Mapping - Consider QGIS

    -   Only for Visualization - Consider Canva for basic visualization that is not data-intensive.

## Want Free , Flexible, Reproducible, Possibility of Automation?

-   Consider R (or Python)

### R / Julia

-   if working in academia , statistics

### Python

-   If working in web-development , more general purpose coding

## Want to go one step further ?

Consider combining R for statistics, Python for Web Development and SQL for Database Management.\
\
Learning your first language is the hardest! Get a grasp of one language it becomes easier to pivot to other languages.

## TAKEHOME MESSAGES

-   Pick your tool for the job you want to do.

-   Use a combination of tools if the need be.

-   R is a language , not a straight replacement for STATA or SPSS.

-   It offers flexibility, reproducibility, open source and possibilty to automate

-   IT CAN BE LEARNT. WE WILL DO THIS
