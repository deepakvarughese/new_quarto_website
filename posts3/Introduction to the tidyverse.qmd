## Origin Story

## Origin

"The hardest part of collaborative data analysis is not finding the correct statistical model, but getting the data into a form that you can actually work with. This challenge led to the creation of the [reshape package](http://had.co.nz/reshape/) which made it easier to work with a variety of input datasets by first converting to a “molten” form which you could then “cast” into the desired form."

-   Hadley Wickham

## Principles of Tidy Data

-   Each variable must have its own column

-   Each observation must have its own row

-   Each value must have its own cell
